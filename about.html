        <p>Hello!, welcome to my blog my name is Ethan Oles and I am Sophomore at Michigan State University studying Information Science. I am a huge Michigan State sports fan which is why I created this blog. 
        <ul> <p>My favorite things about Michigan State University are:</p>
            <li>Sporting Events</li>
            <li>Ability to Meet New People</li>
            <li>Amount of Clubs</li>
            <li>My Professors</li>

        </ul>
        <p>I also enjoy watching the Detroit Sports teams such as the Lions, Pistons, Tigers, Red Wings, and Detroit City FC. I am passionate about technology and using technology to better the world. I also enjoy creating personal projects that relate to what I am interested in. I am a sports fan but I also enjoy watching tv shows and movies in my free time.
