        <p>Michigan State’s roster includes a lot of talent from last year’s sweet sixteen team. Players such as Tyson Walker and AJ Hoggard will lead the Spartan guards at the Point Guard and Shooting Guard positions. Jaden Akins is set to start at Small Forward for the Spartans this year. Malik Hall who has been with the Spartans since 2019 will use his playing experience and start for the Spartans at PF. While the senior Mady Sissoko will begin his second year as the starting center for the Spartans. 
        </p>
        <p>Other players returning from last year that will most likely come off the bench include. Jaxon Kohler, a center who will be beginning his Sophomore season this year. Carson Cooper, a center who is looking to improve on a surprising season he had as a Freshman. Finally, Tre Holloman a Sophomore guard who is looking to gain more confidence and play a bigger role than his freshman year. 
        </p>
        <p>Michigan State has a top three recruiting class in the country for this season much stronger than usual. There are four new faces arriving on the team this year and looking to make immediate impacts as freshmen. The team’s only 5 star recruit from this past season is Xavier Booker who is one of the top Forwards in the freshmen class this year. Another freshman is Coen Carr who is known for his athleticism and is hoping to use that to gain a lot of playing time. The only guard in the freshmen class is Jeremy Fears, head coach Tom Izzo has said how vocal he is and could potentially be a team leader in the future. The freshmen is small forward Gehrig Normand, he is the lowest rated recruit in the class but has many upsides and his shooting could give him a role in the near future.

        <h3>The Schedule and My Expectations for the Season</h3>
        <p>Ethan Oles</p>
        <time datetime="2023-10-29" title="October 29, 2023">Oct 29, 2023</time>
        <p>Tom Izzo, the head coach of the basketball team, is known for playing a very tough non-conference schedule. This year is no different as Michigan State will play three top 25 ranked teams as a part of their non-conference schedule. Including #2 Duke, #12 Arizona, and #20 Baylor. Michigan State will also play a tough big ten schedule as always. Including two games against #25 ranked Illinois. They also play #3 Purdue but will only play them once in an away game. Michigan State will also face their in-state rivals in Michigan twice. This schedule is a tough one but will show the level of team Michigan State has.
        </p>
        <p>This team looks very strong this year and I expect they will do well. With the recruiting class that we had it will really help improve our depth because these talented players will provide meaningful minutes. The freshmen from last season who are now sophomores have a season under their belt. Experience is only gained through time and is very helpful in succeeding in college basketball. I believe the current Sophomores have improved tremendously from last season and I am very excited to see how they will do. The Juniors and Seniors of this team are the leaders. That is how it always works in college basketball, but I really believe we have a lot of leaders on this team. I believe that they can help the underclassmen develop while maintaining a high level of basketball and teamwork. My predictions for this season are that the Spartans win the Big Ten regular season and conference tournament championships. Become a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament and make it to the Final Four. These may be high expectations but with a team of this caliber I believe it will happen.
